# Tox Eraser - Food Supplements

## What is it for?

ToxEraser Food Supplements is a software designed with the aim to identify risky food supplements and suggest safer alternatives as remedy. The first component of the tool is represented by an archive consisting of relevant lists and databases, which are described in detail in the **Appendix**. They are all drafted by panel of experts working on chemical risk assessment at Mario Negri institute. By assuming the selected lists as a source of independent information, the systematic evaluation of what resulted from their assessment was meant to offer a comprehensive classification of food supplements, at least in comparison with the classification endorsed by each single list.
Moreover, a read-across analysis enforces the substitution process, making the substitution possible even when the ingredient is not included in the archive. Finally, a series of structural alerts have been implemented in order to detect possible evidence of toxicity for different toxicological endpoints. The structural alerts implemented within the tools are extracted using the SARpy software and curated by IRFMN.
ToxEraser Food Supplements works with a single ingredient, entered in the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
ToxEraser Food Supplements is a stand-alone application and it has been designed with flexible capabilities for future extension in mind (possibility to add new lists of ingredients or set new functionalities).
